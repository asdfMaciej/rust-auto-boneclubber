# Rust automatic boneclubber
Automatical boneclubber for the game Rust, works in 1080p or 1600x900 resolution only. Made in AHK.
Requires the inventory to be full except the last row and hotbar, and requires having bone fragments in it [used to craft bone clubs].
Aim at an armored door, press CTRL+N and enjoy. It will use 240 bone fragments per one loop, making 12 bone clubs [18,75% of the amount required to destroy a door].

Please note that one loop takes a bit over 4 minutes and 15 seconds to complete, if you would like to go AFK during runtime.
